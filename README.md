# template-electron-cra

A template project for developing electron application by react (CRA), with using redux and typescript. 
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].

You can create your own project by importing this template project.

## Use Visual Studio Code as Your Editor

It's recommanded for you to use `Visual Studio Code` to develop your electron application.

After you creating your own project, you need to rename the `template-electron-cra.code-workspace` file to `<YouProjectName>.code-workspace`, and then use vscode to open it.

You need to install three vscode packages: `ESLint`, `Prettier - Code formatter` and `Todo Tree`.
